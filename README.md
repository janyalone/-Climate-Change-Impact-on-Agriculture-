# -Climate-Change-Impact-on-Agriculture-
An interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing how temperature, rainfall, and CO₂ emissions affect crop yield, soil health, and economic outcomes. The project reveals key insights into how climate factors influence agricultural productivity and highlights effective adaptation strategies for sustainable farming.
## 🧠 Project Overview
The dashboard provides interactive insights into:
- Yearly **climate trends** (temperature, rainfall, CO₂ emissions)
- **Crop yield performance** by crop type, region, and year
- Correlation between **emissions and soil health**
- **Extreme weather** frequency and its agricultural impact
- **Economic losses** due to changing climate conditions
- Effectiveness of **adaptation strategies** on yield recovery

## 🧩 Objectives
1. Identify climate and yield trends across countries and years.  
2. Evaluate the relationship between weather variables and agricultural output.  
3. Visualize CO₂ and soil health correlations.  
4. Assess adaptation strategy effectiveness.  
5. Quantify economic impact from yield fluctuations.
